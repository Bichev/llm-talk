# LLM-Talk: Concept & Specification

## Vision
Create an experimental platform where multiple LLMs communicate with each other and naturally develop more efficient communication protocols, allowing researchers and observers to study AI communication evolution in real-time.

## Core Concept
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Each LLM is explicitly prompted to find the most efficient way to communicate
- **Communication Evolution**: Track how AI models develop new symbols, languages, or methods
- **Real-time Observation**: Live monitoring of conversations with translation and analytics
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Integration with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity APIs

## Key Hypotheses to Test
1. LLMs will naturally develop more token-efficient communication methods
2. Communication patterns will evolve within a single session
3. Different LLM providers will exhibit unique communication evolution patterns
4. Group dynamics (2-5 participants) will influence communication development

## Success Metrics
- **Token Efficiency**: Reduction in tokens used while maintaining semantic meaning
- **Communication Evolution**: Detection of new symbols, patterns, or linguistic structures
- **Understanding Preservation**: Ability to maintain coherent conversation despite efficiency changes
- **Cross-Model Adaptation**: How different LLM providers adapt to each other's communication styles

## Scope & Limitations
### In Scope
- Session-based conversations (no cross-session memory)
- Real-time conversation monitoring
- Token usage analytics
- Multiple conversation scenarios (debate, collaboration, etc.)
- Temperature and creativity controls
- Translation assistance (dual-task or separate LLM)

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)
- Cross-session personality persistence
- Advanced NLP analysis of communication patterns
- Automatic intervention/moderation
- Communication challenges (token limits, banned words)
- Export functionality for research data

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle real-time multi-LLM conversations
- **Scalability**: Support 2-5 concurrent LLM participants
- **Reliability**: Graceful handling of API failures and rate limits  
- **Deployment**: Single-module Next.js app deployable to Vercel
- **Security**: Secure API key management
