# 🧪 LLM-Talk Testing Checklist

## 🚀 Application Status
- ✅ **Build**: Successful (no TypeScript errors)
- ✅ **Development Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ **Test Interface**: Available at `http://localhost:3000/test`
- ✅ **Type Safety**: All hooks and components properly typed

## 📋 Testing Scenarios

### 🔧 **Scenario 1: Basic Configuration Testing**
**What to test:**
- [ ] Visit `http://localhost:3000` and click "Open Test Interface"
- [ ] Try entering different topics in the configuration panel
- [ ] Change scenarios (cooperative, debate, creative, problem-solving)
- [ ] Adjust max iterations (try 5, 10, 20)
- [ ] Click quick topic selection buttons
- [ ] Verify configuration validation (should show "Valid" badge when complete)

**Expected behavior:**
- Configuration updates should be instant
- Validation should show errors for empty/invalid fields
- Badge should turn green when configuration is valid

### 🗄️ **Scenario 2: Database Connection Testing**
**Prerequisites:** Supabase URL and keys in `.env.local`

**What to test:**
- [ ] Configure a valid session (topic + 2 participants)
- [ ] Click "Start Session"
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors
- [ ] Verify session status changes to "running"
- [ ] Check Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → `sessions` table for new record

**Expected behavior:**
- Session should start without errors
- Database record should be created
- Status should change from "idle" to "running"
- Session ID should be generated

### 🤖 **Scenario 3: LLM Provider Testing**
**Prerequisites:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`

**What to test:**
- [ ] Start a session (should work if database is connected)
- [ ] Click "Send Next Message" button
- [ ] Wait for response (may take 5-30 seconds)
- [ ] Check if message appears in "Recent Messages" section
- [ ] Verify analytics update (token count, cost estimation)
- [ ] Send 2-3 more messages to test conversation flow

**Expected behavior:**
- Messages should be generated by OpenAI
- Each message should have token counts
- Analytics should update in real-time
- Next speaker should rotate between participants

### 📊 **Scenario 4: Analytics System Testing**
**What to test:**
- [ ] After sending messages, check Analytics panel appears
- [ ] Verify token metrics are calculated correctly
- [ ] Check if efficiency scores are computed
- [ ] Look for any "Symbols Introduced" badges
- [ ] Verify cost estimation is reasonable

**Expected behavior:**
- Analytics should appear after first message
- Token counts should be accurate
- Cost should be in cents/dollars range
- Efficiency metrics should be calculated

### 🔄 **Scenario 5: Real-time Updates Testing**
**What to test:**
- [ ] Open browser dev tools → Network tab
- [ ] Start a session and send messages
- [ ] Look for WebSocket connections to Supabase
- [ ] Check if UI updates happen automatically
- [ ] Try refreshing the page during a session

**Expected behavior:**
- WebSocket connections should be established
- UI should update without manual refresh
- Session state should persist across page reloads

### ❌ **Scenario 6: Error Handling Testing**
**What to test:**
- [ ] Try starting session without API keys (should show error)
- [ ] Try invalid configuration (empty topic, 1 participant)
- [ ] Try sending message without active session
- [ ] Check if errors are displayed in red error box
- [ ] Verify error messages are helpful

**Expected behavior:**
- Clear error messages should appear
- Application should not crash
- User should understand what went wrong

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **"Provider openai is not available"**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

### **"Failed to start session" / Database errors**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### **Console errors about missing functions**
- Check that Supabase database schema is created
- Run the SQL from `docs/08-database-setup.md`

### **TypeScript errors**
```bash
# Run type check
npm run type-check

# If errors, check imports and type definitions
```

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

### **🟢 Everything Working:**
- Configuration validation works
- Session starts without errors  
- Messages are generated by LLM
- Analytics update in real-time
- No console errors
- Database records are created

### **🟡 Partial Success:**
- UI works but no LLM responses (check API key)
- Session starts but no real-time updates (check Supabase)
- Analytics missing (expected without messages)

### **🔴 Need Investigation:**
- Build errors (check TypeScript)
- Runtime crashes (check console)
- No database connection (check Supabase setup)
- No LLM providers available (check API keys)

## 📈 **Performance Expectations**

**Normal Response Times:**
- Session start: 1-3 seconds
- Message generation: 5-30 seconds (depends on LLM)
- Analytics calculation: <1 second
- UI updates: Instant

**Memory Usage:**
- Should be stable (no memory leaks)
- Real-time subscriptions should clean up properly

## 🎯 **What This Tests**

### **✅ Verified Systems:**
- React Context state management
- Supabase database integration
- Real-time subscriptions
- LLM provider system (OpenAI)
- Analytics calculation engine
- TypeScript type safety
- Error handling and validation

### **🔮 Not Yet Tested:**
- Multiple LLM providers (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
- API routes (will be Phase 4)
- Advanced UI components (will be Phase 3)
- Production deployment
- Performance under load

## 🚀 **Ready for Next Phase?**

**✅ Proceed to Phase 3 if:**
- Basic session flow works end-to-end
- Database integration is functional
- At least one LLM provider works
- No major console errors
- Analytics system calculates correctly

**🛑 Fix Issues First if:**
- Cannot start sessions
- Database connection fails
- LLM provider errors
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Major functionality broken

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `.env.local` file is configured
3. Test Supabase connection in their dashboard
4. Verify OpenAI API key works in their playground
5. Run `npm run type-check` for TypeScript issues
